# Group Project 4
## <i>A supervised learning model predicting accident prone areas in Victoria.</i>

## Project Overview
 To work cohesively as a team to create a machine learning model that is linked to a front end web application as depicted in the image below:

### Understanding the problem
1. Victorian Police plan for emergency response annually especially around significant public holidays such as easter, christmas and melbourne cup. 
   Which Local Government Areas should the police target their resources? 
2. Examine road crashes data over the past five years to find out: Which factors contribute to car accidents on Victorian roads?
   Which areas are prone to accidents?
3. Can Victorian Police employ a deep learning application to predict Local Government Areas prone to accidents based on specific factors? 

### Requirements
    -   Clean, normalise and standardise data before modelling
    -   Write a python script to initialise, train and evaluate a model with at least 75% accuracy
    -   Optimise and evaluate the model ensuring iterative changes are made to the model
    -   Overall model performance is printed/displayed at the end of the cript
    -   Create a web application that links to the model through an API
